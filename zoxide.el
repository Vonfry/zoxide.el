This is used by `zoxide-find-file' and `zoxide-find-file-with-query'.  For other

interactive, it will be called by `call-interactively' in
`default-directory'with target path.  Otherwise, the target path is passed as
argument.

For example, you set this to `counsel-fzf' to open file with fzf through
counsel or `dired' to open directory instead of a file."
